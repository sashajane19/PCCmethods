R code for phytoplankton community composition (PCC) methods paper. These scripts were developed with Dr. Dylan Catlett (dylan.catlett@whoi.edu) to analyze 18S rRNA (v9 region) from the NAAMES and EXPORTS projects. All data are available at https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/experiment/NAAMES and https://seabass.gsfc.nasa.gov/cruise/EXPORTSNP.
